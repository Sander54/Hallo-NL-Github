creation repository + breanches +pull+merg ALL within GITHUB 24-04-2017

let make some changes in the read-me file IN THE BRANCH readme-edits

ok?

Wel, I have succeeded again: made changes in a copy of the readme-file which was held in a 2nd branch
Then I made a Pull request and compared the 2 readme-files,
and finnally I merged the adjusted readme file from de edit branch to the master
(and deleted the 2nd branch)
