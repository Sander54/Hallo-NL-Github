lets make some changes in the read-me file IN THE BRANCH readme-edits

ok?

Wel, I have succeeded again: made changes in a copy of the readme-file which was held in a 2nd branch
Then I made a Pull request and compared the 2 readme-files,
and finnally I merged the adjusted readme file from de edit branch to the master
(and deleted the 2nd branch)

Oeps There was missing 1 letter: do it all over again!!!
(very nice that after each change you can commit this straight after the adjustment..

Hello I have succeeded for the second time: but this time by using the same (edit-) branch:
in other words: why delete an edit branch if you can use this several times...

Ok enough "talking" lets pull and merge for the 3th time (in a row)...


 Ik (mijn Laptop) heb de file ontvangen en wijzig het nu (23:50 24-04-2017)
  met deze tekst.  ga het zo weer terug sturen!!! Sander54
